/**
 * Tracks which blocked devices are currently nearby (within Bluetooth range as reported
 * by [DeviceWatcherService]) and manages the grace-period delay before a departed device
 * is removed from the nearby set.
 *
 * **Why in-memory (not Room)**:
 * CDM delivers presence *transitions*, not current state. Persisting to Room would risk a
 * stale `isNearby=true` after a missed [onDeviceDisappeared] callback, resulting in phantom
 * notifications with no self-healing path. The in-memory default of empty (no phantom) is
 * the safer failure mode.
 *
 * **Grace period**:
 * When a device disappears, [scheduleRemoval] starts a [DETECTION_GRACE_PERIOD_MS] countdown.
 * If the device reappears within that window, [cancelPendingRemoval] cancels the countdown.
 * Jobs run in the supplied [applicationScope] so they survive [DeviceWatcherService] destruction
 * — the service is short-lived and its own scope would be cancelled before any delay could fire.
 *
 * @param applicationScope Application-scoped scope; must outlive any individual service instance.
